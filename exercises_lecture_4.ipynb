    "\n",
    "In the lecture we implemented the `connect` function that makes railway oriented error handling possible. You find this function below, together with mocked versions of `validate`, `updateDb`, and `sendEmail`. You'll expand on this example in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want to add a prefix to each `request`. This function should take a string `s` and return `\"Request\" + s`. This function will never produce an error, so it cannot switch to the error track! Think about whether we can still apply `connect` to it and then add the prefix step between `validate` and `updateDb`.\n",
    "2. Our use case slightly changed, we now always want to send an email, to keep everyone updated even if an error occurs in validation or in the database. However, sending the email can still go wrong. At the end of track we still need a `Result` (`Ok` if the email was sent successfully, `Error` if the email failed). We should never get an `Error` from the database, as we just keep everyone up to date with the email and then it's fine. \n",
    "In order to do this we need to be able to switch back from the error track to the happy track. Take a look at the last slide of lecture 4 for the complete track we want to build.\n",
    "Now write the function `recover` that simply prepends the string with whether the request failed or not. When recover receives `Ok value` it returns the string `\"success: value\"`, when it receives `Error value` it returns the string `\"error: value\"`.\n",
    "Then write the function `catch` to connect `recover` in the pipeline and test the pipeline!"
